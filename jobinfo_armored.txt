  JOB IDEA: Armored Van
  
    - Overview
      Players can go on duty as an armored truck driver.
      The truck is empty until players pick up money from ATMs, banks, business
      The player can either continue to pick up more cash, or drop it off.
      Players get paid when they drop money loads off.
    
    - How to Obtain
      Go on duty at the Union Repository
    
    - How to Cancel/End Duty
      Leave the truck behind or return it to the Union Repository.
      Leaving the truck behind with cash inside results in Wanted Points
    
    - Missions
      Players will be given multiple locations to choose from for picking up.
      They can continue to pick up money from all locations until they're 
      either full, or want to drop off. This allows players to make their own
      plans, plan their own routes, and avoid being predictable.
      
    - Special Notes
      Players can steal the money they're picking up, but they immediately
      become wanted. 
      
      Players can attack armored vehicles for the loot. Just like in GTA
      Online, throwing a sticky bomb on the back of the truck and blowing the 
      doors off will result in dumping all the cash out of it.
      
      Armored Car robberies result in an immediate Wanted Level.
      The money stolen can't be laundered for 30 minutes.

      <h3>What is Cops and Robbers ('CNR')?</h3>
      <p>CNR is a casual game where you, the player, can either commit crimes and
      become wanted, or join the police force and go after wanted players!
      Alternatively, if you're just a boring no-lifer like the kind of guy who
      sits at home for several hours a day writing game scripts for free (send
      help please), you can just stay innocent and work legal jobs to earn cash
      for cars, houses, etc.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to give you the opportunity to play our take on an online
      GTA game, while letting players be the cops. As you gain rank in being
      a civilian, you'll earn more money for doing actions in game. As you gain
      rank as a cop, you'll gain access to better duty weapons, police vehicles,
      and even be able to go on duty as SWAT.
      </p>
      <p>Rob gas stations, do a bank heist, sleep with a hooker, sell drugs,
      do drugs, drive drunk, buy a bar, become a home owner,
      chase bad guys, kill cops, fly a plane, skydive, drive your partner
      off the cliff at Mount Chiliad...
      Your only limit is your imagination - and the time I have to script things.

    <div id="rules">
      <ul><strong>SPECIAL RULES:</strong>
        <li><strong>The 'Roleplay Rule':</strong>
        WE ARE NOT A ROLE-PLAY SERVER. We do not require anyone to RP.
        You are more than welcome to attempt to RP with each other,
        but Server Staff will not enforce or encourage RP. Go be weirdos
        somewhere else.</li>
        <li><strong>The 'Deathmatch Rule':</strong>
        Send each other to Hell, we don't care... But killing the 
        same person repeatedly, commiting law enforcement genocide,
        or mindlessly slaughtering innocents is excessive. Trust me,
        if you're being an asshole by murdering everyone, you won't win against
        an admin.. They can get free guns, and teleport to you. Get the drift?
        </li>
        <li><strong>The 'Snowflake Rule':</strong>
        Obviously, an adult game with adult themes will have adult situations.
        If you are easily offended, you should really be playing Minecraft and
        not Grand Theft Auto. Your PLAYER CHARACTER is not your PHYSICAL SELF.
        Your player may get held at gunpoint, shot, assaulted, beaten,
        diseased, stranded, tied up, handcuffed, tasered, etc.
        </li>

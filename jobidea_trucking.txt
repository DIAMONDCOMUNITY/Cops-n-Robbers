  JOB IDEA: Trucking
  
    - Overview
      Players can go on duty as a truck driver, getting missions to pick
      up cargo trailers. Legal missions are offered randomly and exclusively
      to a client. Meaning, each mission is only being offered to that
      individual player; It's not shared or first-come first serve. However,
      illegal cargo missions (drugs, guns, etc) are offered to all drivers on 
      a first come first serve basis. The first person to pick up the trailer
      wins the contract. The mission ends when the trailer is dropped off or
      disconnected.
    
    - How to Obtain
      Players obtain a truck at one of the duty positions.
      The game will randomly offer legal missions.
      The server will randomly offer illegal missions.
      A player accepts the mission by going to the pickup location.
      Once connected, the trailer gets taken to the dropoff.
    
    - How to Cancel/End Duty
      Players can cancel a mission simply by dropping their trailer and leaving
      it behind, or destroying the trailer (drop in the lake, etc).
      Players can end duty by leaving the truck behind, or returning to the 
      job location where they went on duty.
    
    - Missions
      Trucks will be given waypoints of where to pick up an available load.
      When the mission is complete they will be paid.
